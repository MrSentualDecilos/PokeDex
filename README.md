This is a personal project I made with Kotlin for displaying my portfolio to recruiters, but feel free to
check it out and download it to take on ideas!

It's a simple App that shows all Pokemon and details for each one of them. More coming soon!

For this project I used:
- Kotlin
- MVVM
- Clean architecture
- Unit testing
- Dagger Hilt for DI
- Room DB
- CI/CD
